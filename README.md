### Explanation
My song consists of three parts: a buildup, a climax, and a conclusion. They 
correspond to a sunrise, day, and sunset, which was the inspiration for my song.

The first part consists of long ambiance notes with birds chirping in the 
background. Some extra features I added were a random choice of chords, a tempo
that slows down, and pan values that cause the notes to flow back and forth
between the left and right speakers.

The second part of the song includes a bunch of instruments. The centerpiece 
(and constant background notes) of the song are a sequence of chords that I 
chose, with an accompanying drum beat that isn't too agressive. Later on, I add
in a guero (Latin American percussion instrument) and a kalimba (African hand
piano), which make the song more melodic and interesting, while maintaining the
relaxation. There are also piano chords to add a little bit of spice. Towards 
the end of the second part, most of the instruments fade out and leave just the
kalimba and the drums.

The third part of the song is the same as the first except that the bird noises
are replaced by wave sounds. The amplitude of the notes slowly fade until they 
are very quiet when the song ends.
