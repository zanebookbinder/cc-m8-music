### Three music pieces that I find relaxing:

#### Weightless - Marconi Union
I did a study in my Brains in Motion class about the effects of music videos
on heart rate, and I used this song as the "relaxing" test case, so I've known
about it for a while now. I think what makes it so relaxing for me is the 
constant hum underneath the more prominant xylophone sounds. It's very 
consistent, so it isn't jarring at all. That steadiness makes the song remind 
me of feeling calm, which would definitely help when prepping for a test.

#### Coffee Relaxing Jazz (https://www.youtube.com/@coffeerelaxingjazz)
The videos that this YouTube channel posts are very calming because the drums
are very soft (I think they might use something other than a drumstick) and the
piano notes are relatively high on the scale. It makes me feel comfort because
the melody feels simple and familiar. I think that sense of comfort would allow
me to dive into studying without distraction or worry, and in that way would
be very helpful.

#### Space Song by Beach House
This song is very relaxing because the lyrics are almost hypotizingly-calming. 
Similarly to Weightless, it also has a constant hum in the background that 
creates consistency between lyrics and more prominent instruments. The words 
and notes remind me of sadness, but in a very calm way (not distraught). This 
song repeats the same sequences of notes multiple times, which would also help
to avoid distractions while studying. It doesn't grab the listeners attention,
but instead serves as great background music.

### Musical Idea
I think that I want my musical idea to be sunrise. Watching a sunrise is a very
soothing and long process, and it has that same consistency that some of the 
songs above do. I think starting from lower/quieter notes and building slowly
upwards would be a good theme. I think a song like that would both calm the 
listener and build them up to go crush the test!

### Features that I'll want to include
- relatively low bpm (I like the idea of starting around 60bpm and lowering to
50bpm)
- a constant background sound
- gentle notes (maybe pan-flute or piano)
- flowing sensation across the notes
- at least 5 minutes
